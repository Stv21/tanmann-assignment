### 1. Clone the Repository and Create a Branch

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Create and switch to a new branch following the naming convention `yourname_feature_classname`:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b yourname_feature_classname
   ```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Fix any dependency issues (if any dependencies fail to install or you encounter errors, resolve them by checking for compatible versions or missing packages).

### 3. Set Up the Frontend
